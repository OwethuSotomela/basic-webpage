                    <p> I would love to visit <b>New York</b> because it's a place where brains and
                        bodies in indecent proximity to one
                        another create the sparks of genius, invention, progress.
                        New York City is the greenest city in America. The 843-acre
                        Central Park, the most famous park in the city, is actually
                        only the 5th largest. Jog, walk, bike, in-line skate, horseback ride,
                        ice skate, rent row boats, play basketball, softball, soccer, tennis,
                        enjoy special events and festivals in the cityâ€™s 1,700 parks and playgrounds,
                        or just kick back and people-watch.</p>
